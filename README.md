# Tree Parser

This program is a simple Go program that reads in a YAML file representing a tree structure and outputs the values of all the leaves in the tree.

## Usage

To use this program, simply run go run main.go in the same directory as the YAML file you wish to parse. The program will output the values of each leaf in the tree, separated by a newline character.

## Author

This program was written by an AI language model developed by OpenAI, and adapted by me to meet the specific requirements of the task.
